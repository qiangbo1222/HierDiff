This GitHub repository will soon contain the code for the ICML paper titled 'Coarse-to-Fine: a Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Molecule Generation in 3D'. We are currently in the process of finalizing the code and will release it here as soon as possible.

The code will be available under the insert license type license. We encourage others to use and build upon our work, but please abide by the terms of the license.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to create an issue in the repository. Thank you for your interest in our work!
